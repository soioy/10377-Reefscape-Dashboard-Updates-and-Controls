Change log to 10377 Code

Made new Branch Called Dasboard Updates. Intention is to create dashboard inputs as well as verify advantagekit istallation
2025 03 31
1.  Modified Build.gradle to allow for Real Drivers Dashboard to be used with Simulation.

2.  Deleted non working path and autos from PathPlanner that were not working.
3. Added workable Autos.  Nothing fancy.  If used, they need triggers added to make things like elevator to move to score. Current Triggers to not match the 10377 Robot.

4. Added Absolute Encoder Offset to the ArmConstants.java file (Line 11).

5. Added Limit switch code to zero arm, and button to dashboard to simulate limit switch in the case we don't install one for arm starting postion.

6. Added dashboard inputs for arm PID tuning.

7. Updated SIM to allow use of actual Drivers Station in Simulation (dont forget to wait for box to check after SIM Launch)

2025 04 01

1. Changes to Arm Code:
  ‚úÖ Proper use of limit switch and encoder

  ‚úÖ Manual and PID control support

  ‚úÖ Feedforward voltage compensation

  ‚úÖ PID values are editable via Shuffleboard and saved with Preferences

  ‚úÖ Voltage limiting logic fixed

  ‚úÖ Setpoint and position indicators on dashboard

  ‚úÖ All constants aligned with expected encoder scale

  ‚úÖ Initialization logic improved

2. Robot Container updates:
  ‚úÖKeep canFold with Override: Retain the safety condition for manual arm control with a "Manual Override" toggle.

  ‚úÖFull Arm PID Tuning: Add controls to tune kP, kI, kD and apply them via a button.

  ‚úÖArm Setpoint Tuning: Add editable setpoints for L0‚ÄìL4 with test buttons.

  ‚úÖArm Position Indicators: Show green when the arm is at each setpoint (within tolerance) and yellow otherwise.

 Changelog ‚Äì April 1, 2025
üß† Strategic Planning & Logic
  Finalized the scoring logic flowchart:

  Inputs from Driver Controller (A, B, Y = L2, L3, L4; X = Load)

  Incorporated canFold and canRaise logic for interlocking arm and elevator movement

  Sequenced: rotate arm to safe ‚Üí raise/lower elevator ‚Üí rotate arm to setpoint

üéÆ Controller Mappings (Driver - Controller 0)
  Button A ‚Üí Score at Level 2 (L2)

  Button B ‚Üí Score at Level 3 (L3)

  Button Y ‚Üí Score at Level 4 (L4)

  Button X ‚Üí Move to Loading Position

  Arm moves to LOAD_POS (~ -0.25)

  Elevator remains in L0 position

  Elevator will not raise again until arm rotates outward past canRaise threshold

üß∞ Subsystem Enhancements
  Arm
  Added LOAD_POS setpoint and safe position logic for folding/raising

  Implemented canFold() and canRaise() checks

  Added dashboard PID tuning entries and visual layout improvements

  Refactored Arm.java for improved clarity and shorter code without losing functionality

  Preserved your working files and restored when necessary

  Elevator
  Added column-style layout for setpoints and "move to" buttons on the dashboard

  Graph is now moved down to prevent widget overlap

  PID controls grouped together

  Added canFold logic status to Shuffleboard for diagnostics

üñ•Ô∏è Shuffleboard Layout
  Rebuilt standard layout with clean tab separation for Arm and Elevator

  All widgets aligned in clean columns

  No widgets on top of graphs

  Graphs and positions moved one block down

  Elevator and Arm Setpoints now align vertically, starting 1 square from top

üîß RobotContainer.java
  Implemented configureButtonBindings():

  All controller logic added for driver scoring buttons

  Sequence of actions follows safe movement logic

  Fixed X Button: previously mapped to ‚Äúbrake,‚Äù now correctly moves arm to LOAD_POS

üö´ Bug Fixes & Recovery
  Fixed broken Arm.java, ArmIOReal.java, and RobotContainer.java after misgeneration

  Re-integrated your known-good files

  Resolved build issues related to missing constants in ArmConstants.java

  GEAR_RATIO, ARM_LENGTH, ARM_MASS added












Notes:
Download Pathplanner and updated AdvantageScope on Drivers station computer, as well as computers that are going to be used for programming. Provided below are also other links for future reference:  The advantage kit and Maple sim, are primarly for future reference,  I would not spend too much time on those prior to this weeks competion.
